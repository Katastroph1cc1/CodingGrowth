I am currently in college to obtain my Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I also use Udemy during the term to enhance learning in the specific coding language or tools I am using. I have studied Python, Java, C++, C# and a little HTML. I continue to try and improve in every depeartment as I can. I also am developing a game in Unreal Engine. I have also started working on a project outside of school with the Title IV-D Tracker. I continue to learn and improve each day.
