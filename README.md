I am currently in college getting my Bachelors in Computer Science. I also use Udemy during the term to enhance learning in the specific coding language or tools I am using. I did python and am currently in C++ and will be adding more to this as I do more projects and work throughout my time in college. I continue to try and improve in every depeartment. I am also learning more C# and Java as well to continue to improve and bolster my skills.
